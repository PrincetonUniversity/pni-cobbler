## Using this distro entry requires downloading additional files!!
You will need to add the pull in the vmlinuz and initrd.img files for centos 7.8 into this folder in order for this to be usable.  These files are found here: `http://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/centos/7.8.2003/os/x86_64/images/pxeboot/`
