# Cobbler Import Handler
This is broken in two parts, a simple bash script to handle copying some files around on startup and a python script to handle the messier XMLRPC based work required to actually translate yaml files to hosts/distros/profiles/etc inside cobbler.

## Bash script - cobblerforklift.sh
This script clones the kickstart files, and kickstart snippets to the required locations inside the cobbler data structure. This is required as cobbler will not allow you to refer to `.ks` or snippet files outside of those locations.  Additionally it calls base.py (to be renamed and broken up at somepoint).

## python script - base.py
This handles the heavy lifting of importing data from yaml into the XMLRPC interface used by cobbler. This system directly lifts the keys generated by cobbler on startup and interacts the same way the `cobbler` commandline tool works.
